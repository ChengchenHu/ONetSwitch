###ONetSwitch
The ONetSwitch project sets up an open Software Defined Networking (SDN) platform that make it easy for you to create new network applications. 

ONetSwitch provides several open source reference designs available on GitHub:OpenFlow Switch-SW and OpenFlow Switch-HW. Each reference design consist of open source FPGA RTL Code, Linux OS and open source software. The reference designs can be programmed in both software and hardware to fit your own needs:

* [Product Brief](https://github.com/meshsr/wiki/wiki)  : brief introduction to ONetSwitch. 
* [Workflow](https://github.com/MeshSr/wiki/wiki/Guide-Workflow)    : Design flows on Zynq SoC, related embedded software and high-level applications.
* [Getting-Started](https://github.com/MeshSr/wiki/wiki/Guide-Getting-Started)  : Projects simply utilizing individual design block, for quick hardware test, to make you getting started.
* [Reference Design](https://github.com/MeshSr/wiki/wiki/Guide-Reference-Design) : Projects implementing kinds of network applications, as references, to help your own customization.
